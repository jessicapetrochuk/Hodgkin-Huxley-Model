# Hodgkin Huxley Model
This is a simple implementation of the hodgkin huxley model of a neuron, simulating a single action potential propagating through a cell. 

## Prerequisites
Requires Python 3.8 or greater

## Installation
Clone repository and cd into it 
```
git clone https://github.com/jessicapetrochuk/Hodgkin-Huxley-Model.git
```
Install all requirements
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Run streamlit
```
streamlit run main.py
```
## Usage
Change the "voltage of stimulus" slider to see how the neuron changes depending on how large the input voltage is.
